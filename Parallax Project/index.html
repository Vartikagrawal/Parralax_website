        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the
            physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of
            science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from
            other natural phenomena.Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some
            cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and
            change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the
            "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not
            been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example,
            manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as,
            for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things that
            can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial
            being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.</p>

        <p>There is a wide diversity of living organisms which is the hallmark of life.
            Fruits, vegetables, fish, grains, etc., available in the local market, flowers
            in the parks and gardens, the large variety of birds in the neighbourhood,
            etc., are easy to observe and distinguish by size, shape, colour, smell and
            sound. If one has access to a simple microscope, several other forms of life
            can be seen in drops of water from different sources. Indeed, there is a
            large variation in size and complexity in the living world.
            There are several similarity amongst organisms. It is educational to
            compare and contrast, categorize and segregate different life forms
            including several variety of grasses, cereal crops, flowers, butterflies,
            spiders, beetles, etc., which are easy to collect, study and release back
            from where these are collected. Several scientific systems of classification
            have emerged from observation of morphological and taxonomic
            characteristics - structure of roots, leaves, fruits and flowers, plants,
            number of legs in insects, mouth parts, wings, etc. Correlating local and
            scientific names of these large variety of life forms is interesting research.</p>

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history.</p>
